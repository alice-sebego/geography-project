# geography-project
Create an app in tribute to geography

## What is this ?
It's a mini-project which work Javascript & Jest ; <br /> I want to work on unit tests, so JEST :)<br /> 
Here, I'm going to build a page with :

### A component with data from API
* Create a input
* Enter a postal code
* This component give us data's town from an API - [Zippotamus] (http://www.zippopotam.us/ "link to Zippotamus") : Then, we'll have Name of town, Longitude, Latitude and Region

### A component around countries
* Create questions on several countries
* The user must enter the capital of this country
* When the answer is correct, the country's flag display

## Languages and framework used :
* HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
* JavaScript, JSON from an API
* Jest

***
For Jest, we need Node.JS and NPM environment installed in our system ; then, we have to do these commands on the terminal :
```
mkdir getting-started-with-jest && cd $_
```
```
npm init -y
```
```
npm i jest --save-dev
```
Then, we have to add a modification on the file - package.json :

```javascript
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
```  

## Why I've chosen this theme ?
I want to learn more about API Rest ... quite simply :)

## The progression â€¦ ?
... WIP :)
